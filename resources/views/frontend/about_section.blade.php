            <h2 class="headerline">WHO WE ARE</h2>
            <p>Training A Generation or TAG for short was created to be a positive influence for youth in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
            <p>Our founding team members dream of nurturing and connecting area youth with resources to set them up for lifelong success. We believe in their potential, their abilities, as well as their personal aspirations.</p>
            <p>However collectively for way too long, we’ve come to understand their struggle. The realities of poverty, street violence, and often neglect or even abuse plague these youth in need. It has motivated our team to organize and unite with others who want to be a part of a solution.</p>

            <h4 class="headerline">ATHLETIC COMBINES</h4>
            <p>We believe that a child’s personal fitness is a major key to their lifelong success. One of our main TAG programs will be athletic training. In conjunction with that training we’re going to be holding quarterly combines that allow participate to showcase their progress.</p>

            <h3 class="headerline">EDUCATION</h3>
            <p>One of our core beliefs is that a child’s future is predicted in direct proportion to their success in the classroom. We’ll be offering a computer lab where students can do research, homework, and learn tech skills. We’re in need of people who are willing to be tutors and reading coaches.</p>
            <h3 class="headerline">LEADERSHIP CAMP MONTH</h3>
            <p>In July each year we will hold our student Leadership Camp lead by Dr. Javar Godfrey. He will take students through a curriculum that starts with personal evaluation of strengths and weaknesses to formulating a plan for self improvement and concludes with long term goals.</p>

            <h3 class="headerline">SPIRIT OF SERVICE</h3>
            <p>As a foundation of our program we believe our student participants should give back to their communities. We will be engaging them a wide variety of service projects that cultivates a spirit of service that we believe will last a lifetime.</p>
            <h3 class="headerline">REAL TO REEL</h3>
            <p>Dr. Godfrey will be taping a series of conversations that will give our kids a glimpse into the process many successful people have taken to achieve their acclaim. Our kids will have the opportunity not only to participate in the conversation but be a part of the production team that films them.</p>
